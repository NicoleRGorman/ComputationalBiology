## **Question 1:**  
*Transform these lines into what we need for a proper .csv file:*  <br>

First String    Second      1.22      3.4  
Second          More Text   1.555555  2.2220  
Third           x           3         124  
*Note: Need to figure out to get a tab in .Rmd file*   

  
```
Find:\s  *  

Replace:,

```

**Produces:**  
First String,Second,1.22,3.4  
Second,More Text,1.555555,2.2220  
Third,x,3,124  

**Rationale:**  
-Using the `\s` finds a single space, tab, or line break  
-Add two spaces after the `s` to find anything with 2 or more spaces after  
-Use `*` to mean any character can come next, but it has to be a character

<br>

## **Question 2:**  
*However, my collaborator asked me to please provide to her the list in different format.*  

```
Change this:
Ballif, Bryan, University of Vermont
Ellison, Aaron, Harvard Forest
Record, Sydne, Bryn Mawr

To this:
Bryan Ballif (University of Vermont)
Aaron Ellison (Harvard Forest)
Sydne Record (Bryn Mawr)

```

```
Find:(\w+), (\w+), (\w+ \w+ *\w*)  

Replace:\2 \1 (\3)

```
**Rationale:**

-Using `( )` captures a component in a string  
-Using the `\w+` finds one or more consecutive word characters  
-Following the first capture with a space finds two words  
-This first part gives me the first and last names and then I can reorder in the replace  
-Using a third capture `()` gets the institution  
-Adding `()` in the replace adds (institution)  
-The same expressions as above were used to capture the fist two words of the institution `\w+ \w+`  
-Then the ` *` was used to find any word the had zero or more spaces following  
-And finally, `\w*` was used to get the final word, and also include institutions that included only two words  

## **Question 3:**  
*All of these files are on a single line, so first write a regular expression to place each file name on its own line*  

```
Change this:
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3 0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3 0003 Winder Slide.mp3 0004 Walking Cane.mp3

To this:
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3
0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3
0003 Winder Slide.mp3
0004 Walking Cane.mp3

```

```
Find:  \.\w{3}\s*  

Replace: \.mp3\r

```
**Rationale:**

-Use `\` to find an actual period  
-Use `\w{3}\s* ` to find two characters followed by zero or more spaces  
-Use `.mp3\r` to make a line break anywhere there is .mp3, but also keep .mp3  

## **Question 4:**  
*Now write a regular expression to grab the four digit number and put it at the end of the title:*

```
Change this:
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3
0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3
0003 Winder Slide.mp3
0004 Walking Cane.mp3

To this:
Georgia Horseshoe_0001.mp3
Billy In The Lowground_0002.mp3
Winder Slide_0003.mp3
Walking Cane_0004.mp3

```
```
Find:  

Replace:

```
**Rationale:**

-Using  

## **Question 5:**  
*Here is a data frame with genus, species, and two numeric variables. Write a single regular expression to rearrange the data set like this:*

```
Change this:
Camponotus,pennsylvanicus,10.2,44
Camponotus,herculeanus,10.5,3
Myrmica,punctiventris,12.2,4
Lasius,neoniger,3.3,55

To this:
C_pennsylvanicus,44
C_herculeanus,3
M_punctiventris,4
L_neoniger,55

```
```
Find:  

Replace:

```
**Rationale:**

-Using  

## **Question 6:**  
*Beginning with the original data set, rearrange it to abbreviate the species name like this:*

```
Change this:
Camponotus,pennsylvanicus,10.2,44
Camponotus,herculeanus,10.5,3
Myrmica,punctiventris,12.2,4
Lasius,neoniger,3.3,55

To this:
C_penn,44
C_herc,3
M_punc,4
L_neon,55

```
```
Find:  

Replace:

```
**Rationale:**

-Using  

## **Question 7:**  
*Beginning with the original data set, rearrange it so that the species and genus names are fused with the first 3 letters of each, followed by the two columns of numerical data in reversed order:*

```
Change this:
Camponotus,pennsylvanicus,10.2,44
Camponotus,herculeanus,10.5,3
Myrmica,punctiventris,12.2,4
Lasius,neoniger,3.3,55

To this:
Campen, 44, 10.2
Camher, 3, 10.5
Myrpun, 4, 12.2
Lasneo, 55, 3.3

```
```
Find:  

Replace:

```
**Rationale:**

-Using
